# **Concurrency Utilities in Java**

Java provides several tools in the `java.util.concurrent` package to coordinate multiple threads.
Below are four important ones explained simply.

---

## **1. CountDownLatch**

`CountDownLatch` lets one or more threads **wait until a set of operations in other threads completes**.

### **How it works**

* You give it a count (like number of tasks to wait for).
* Each time a task finishes, it calls `countDown()`.
* The waiting thread calls `await()` and stays paused until the count reaches 0.

### **Example**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            new Thread(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished task");
                latch.countDown();
            }).start();
        }

        latch.await(); // main thread waits
        System.out.println("All tasks finished. Proceeding...");
    }
}
```

**Output**

```
Thread-0 finished task
Thread-1 finished task
Thread-2 finished task
All tasks finished. Proceeding...
```

**Key Point:**
`CountDownLatch` is **one-time use** — once count reaches zero, it cannot be reset.

---

## **2. CyclicBarrier**

`CyclicBarrier` makes a group of threads **wait for each other** to reach a common point (the “barrier”).
Once all reach, the barrier opens, and all threads continue together.

### **How it works (with memory insight)**

* Each thread might have its **own local copy** of variables in CPU cache.
* They all work in parallel and reach a **common barrier point**.
* Once all threads reach the barrier, memory synchronization happens — ensuring **all threads see the latest updated values** before continuing.
* The barrier then **resets automatically**, so it can be reused (unlike `CountDownLatch`).

### **Example**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CyclicBarrierExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, 
            () -> System.out.println("All threads reached the barrier, continuing..."));

        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            new Thread(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reached barrier");
                try {
                    barrier.await();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " continues work");
            }).start();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output**

```
Thread-0 reached barrier
Thread-1 reached barrier
Thread-2 reached barrier
All threads reached the barrier, continuing...
Thread-0 continues work
Thread-1 continues work
Thread-2 continues work
```

**Key Point:**
`CyclicBarrier` can be **reused**, unlike `CountDownLatch`.

---

## **3. Volatile Keyword**

`volatile` ensures **visibility** of changes to a variable across threads.

### **Problem Without volatile**

Each thread can have its **own cached copy** of a variable.
So, if one thread updates the variable, others might **not see the change immediately**.

### **With volatile**

Marking a variable `volatile` tells Java:

* Don’t cache it locally in threads.
* Always read and write directly from **main memory**.

### **Example**

```java
class SharedData {
    volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void writer() {
        flag = true; // write happens in main memory
    }

    public void reader() {
        while (!flag) {
            // waits until flag becomes true
        }
        System.out.println("Flag changed, proceeding...");
    }
}
```

Without `volatile`, the reader thread might keep waiting forever,
because it might never see the updated `flag` value in its local cache.

---

## **4. Atomicity**

**Atomicity** means a task executes **completely or not at all** — it cannot be interrupted midway.

In multithreading, operations like `count++` are **not atomic** (they have multiple steps — read, increment, write).

To make them atomic, Java provides **atomic classes** in `java.util.concurrent.atomic`, like:

* `AtomicInteger`
* `AtomicBoolean`
* `AtomicReference`

These use **low-level CPU instructions (CAS - Compare and Swap)** to ensure thread safety without using locks.

### **Example**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            new Thread(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++) {
                    counter.incrementAndGet(); // atomic operation
                }
            }).start();
        }

        try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.get());
    }
}
```

**Without atomic variable**, race conditions may lead to incorrect counts.
**With atomic variable**, the result is consistent and thread-safe.

| Concept            | Purpose                                                | Reusable | Key Point                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **CountDownLatch** | Wait until other threads finish                        | ❌ No     | One-time latch                     |
| **CyclicBarrier**  | Wait until all threads reach a point                   | ✅ Yes    | Synchronizes thread progress       |
| **volatile**       | Ensures variable visibility across threads             | —        | Always read/write from main memory |
| **Atomic**         | Ensures operation is performed fully (no interference) | ✅ Yes    | Lock-free, thread-safe             |



### Real Life Example

## **1. CountDownLatch — Waiting for Services to Start**

### **Real-life example:**

Imagine a main server that depends on **three microservices** — Database, Cache, and API Gateway.
The server should start **only after all three are up**.

You can use `CountDownLatch(3)` —
each service thread calls `countDown()` when ready,
and the main thread waits with `await()` until all are ready.

**Analogy:**
Like waiting for all teammates to join a meeting before starting the discussion.

---

## **2. CyclicBarrier — Coordinating Game Rounds**

### **Real-life example:**

In an online multiplayer game, several players (threads) must **reach a certain checkpoint** before moving to the next level.

You can use a `CyclicBarrier` —
each player thread waits at the barrier after finishing a round,
and once **all** reach, they all move to the next round together.

**Analogy:**
Like a race where all runners must reach the checkpoint before anyone continues to the next lap.
After that, the barrier resets for the next round.

---

## **3. Volatile — Stopping a Background Thread**

### **Real-life example:**

A background thread is running continuously, checking for updates.
When the user clicks “Stop”, a shared boolean `running` variable is set to `false`.

If the `running` flag is `volatile`, the background thread will **immediately see the change** and stop.

**Analogy:**
Like putting a “Stop” sign on a shared notice board — everyone sees it right away.

---

## **4. Atomic — Counting Visitors on a Website**

### **Real-life example:**

On a website, multiple threads update the **visitor count** simultaneously.
Using a normal `int` may cause race conditions and inaccurate counts.

An `AtomicInteger` ensures **each increment is atomic** — no data loss even when thousands of users visit at the same time.

**Analogy:**
Like a digital counter at a store entrance that safely increases by one for every person entering, even if several enter at once.
